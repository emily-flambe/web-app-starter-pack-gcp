- **Security First**: Authentication, authorization, and security best practices
- **Performance Optimized**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and bundle optimization
- **Monitoring Ready**: Error tracking, performance monitoring, and analytics

### 5. Platform Portability
- **Abstraction Layers**: Easy migration between deployment platforms
- **API Flexibility**: Platform-agnostic API layer design
- **Environment Agnostic**: Works locally, in staging, and production
- **Vendor Lock-in Avoidance**: Use open standards and interoperable technologies

- **Tailwind CSS 4**: No config needed, 5x faster builds
- **TypeScript 5.8**: Latest language features and performance
- **Vitest 3**: 10x faster than Jest with better DX

### Enterprise-Ready Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns, easy to extend
- **Security by Default**: Authentication, authorization, CSRF protection
- **Observability**: Logging, monitoring, and error tracking
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling patterns and performance optimization

### Developer Experience Focus
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Sub-second feedback loops
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
- **Testing Excellence**: Comprehensive test suite with great DX
- **Debugging Tools**: React DevTools, TypeScript debugging, performance profiling

### Platform Flexibility
- **Deployment Agnostic**: Works with Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, AWS
- **API Portability**: Clean abstraction over platform-specific features
- **Database Flexibility**: Support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and serverless databases
- **Authentication Flexibility**: Auth0, Supabase, Firebase, or custom solutions

## Non-Goals

### What We Don't Build
- **CMS Integration**: Focus on application development, not content management
- **E-commerce Specific**: General-purpose foundation, not specialized for commerce
- **Mobile App Development**: Web-first approach, though PWA-ready
- **Legacy Browser Support**: Modern browsers only (ES2022+)

### Complexity We Avoid
- **Over-Engineering**: Keep solutions simple and maintainable
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Avoid platform-specific features that can't be abstracted
- **Configuration Hell**: Prefer convention over configuration
- **Premature Optimization**: Focus on correctness first, performance second

# Project Overview

## Vision

**Create a production-ready web application starter pack for Google Cloud Run** that provides a solid foundation for building modern, scalable web applications with Python backend and React frontend, deployed on Google Cloud Platform.

## Mission Statement

Provide developers with a **production-ready foundation** that includes:

- **FastAPI Backend** with Python for high-performance API development
- **React 18** with TypeScript for modern frontend development
- **Vite** build system for lightning-fast development experience
- **Google Cloud Run** for serverless container deployment
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** for automated testing and deployment

- **Artifact Registry**: Modern container storage (Container Registry deprecated)
- **Make Commands**: Simple `make deploy` for production deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline on push to main

### 2. Modern Full-Stack Development
- **FastAPI Excellence**: High-performance Python backend with automatic API documentation
- **React + TypeScript**: Type-safe frontend development with modern React patterns
- **Vite Development**: Sub-second hot reload and optimized production builds
- **API Integration**: Seamless frontend-backend communication with CORS configured

### 3. Developer Experience Excellence
- **Interactive Setup**: `make init` for interactive project configuration
- **Hot Reload**: Both frontend (Vite) and backend (Uvicorn) with instant feedback
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript frontend with Python type hints in backend
- **Comprehensive Makefile**: All common tasks automated with make commands

### 4. Production Readiness
- **Container Optimization**: Multi-stage Docker builds for minimal image size
- **Platform Architecture**: Correct linux/amd64 builds for Cloud Run compatibility
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health endpoints for container orchestration
- **Static File Serving**: Production-ready static asset serving from FastAPI

### 5. CI/CD Excellence
- **PR Validation**: Automated testing and linting on pull requests
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automatic deployment to Cloud Run on main branch
- **PR Preview Environments**: Optional preview deployments for each PR
- **Security**: Service account authentication and secrets management
